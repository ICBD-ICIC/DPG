# DeLP-Gen

## A DeLP program generator

# Features

# Design

- Bottom-up approch

It begins by generating the basic components on which the most complex structures will be created. First the ¨facts¨ and **presumptions**, which form the **base** of the program.

- Creation by levels

The **arguments** are organized according to a **level** in the program. This level is represented by an integer value that indicates the maximum number of rules that are used in its derivation chain until reaching a base element. In this way, an argument of level _N_ must have a rule of level _N-1_ and so on until reaching the base components (facts and presumptions).

- Defeaters for top-level arguments

**Dialectical trees** are generated for each **top-level argument** of the program.
